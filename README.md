Install NodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en.
Install iTunes at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210384.
Install Discord at https://discord.com/.

See requirements.txt to see the requirements to install for NodeJS.
This will only work when listening to iTunes on the same computer you are using Discord on.

Good luck.
